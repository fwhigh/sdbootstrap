\title{Online Distributed Bootstrap for Big Data}
\author{William High}
\date{27 April 2015}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

This document outlines an Online Bag of Little Bootstraps (OBLB) idea.

\end{abstract}

\section{Bootstrap}

The original bootstrap is by \cite{bib:efron}. This is the basic,
nonparametric bootstrap involving resampling $n$ data points with replacement
$n$ times in $r$ total iterations, where $r \gtrsim 200$. An analysis pipeline
is executed at each bootstrap iteration, and a histogram of a resulting
statistic is built up in the process. The histogram is an estimator of the
sample distribution of that statistic. The mean of the bootstrap distribution
is an estimate of the sample mean; the standard deviation is an estimate of
the standard error on the mean; confidence intervals are computed on the
histograms directly; and covariance on multivariate statistics can be computed
on the joint bootstrap distribution directly.

\section{Online Bootstrap}

The online bootstrap (OB) is sketched by \cite{bib:onlineboot} and is
incorporated into Vowpal Wabbit. Those authors noted that the number of times
a single data point is resampled in one iteration of the traditional bootstrap
is distributed as $Poisson(\lambda = 1)$ for reasonable $r$. This suggests
using an importance weight $W = w^{\prime}w$ for each data point in a stream,
where $w^{\prime}$ is the input importance weight of the data point and $w
\sim Poisson(\lambda = 1)$ is a weight that emulates bootstrap resampling.

\section{Bag of Little Bootstraps}

The Bag of Little Bootstraps is by \cite{bib:blb}. These authors had in mind
big data that is split across nodes, such as on the Hadoop Filesystem. The BLB
procedure is to run the bootstrap on each node that can locally access,
compute a statistic (e.g.\ the mean, confidence interval) on each bootstrap
distribution separately, then collect the statistic from each node and average
to produce a global statistic.

As stated, the method requires that you know the size of each data split and
the total size of the data set, and that you can compute and store a reservoir
of resample indexes in memory. It also makes the interesting choice of
aggregating up the bootstrap distribution to a summary statistic on each node,
and then average each summary statistic, which speeds up the algorithm but
doesn't allow for the mining of additional bootstrap distribution summary
statistics after the fact.

\section{Online Bag of Little Bootstraps}

Given that $r$ is typically chosen to be of order $10^2$ to $10^4$ or so, it's
reasonable to aggregate and persist $r$ bootstrap buckets on a node or set of
nodes using an online bootstrap bucket update rule.

The algorithm is given in \ref{onlineblb} and uses \ref{onlinewmean}.

\begin{algorithm}

\EndFor
\EndFor
\For{each $i \gets 1$ to $\infty$}
\State Randomly assign tuple $(X_i,w^{\prime}_i)$ to node $j$
\For{each $k \gets 1$ to $r$}
\State $W \gets w^{\prime}_i \times Poisson(\lambda = 1)$
\State $(\hat\theta_{jk}, w_{jk}) \gets \mathrm{OnlineUpdate}(\hat\theta_{jk}, w_{jk}, X_i, W)$
\State $(\hat\theta_{k}, w_{k}) \gets \mathrm{BootstrapAggregate}(\hat\theta_{k}, w_{k},\hat\theta_{jk}, w_{jk})$
\EndFor
\EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\Procedure{BootstrapAggregate}{}

\State $w_{k} \gets 0$
\EndFor
\For{each $k \gets 1$ to $r$}
\State $\theta \gets (w\theta + WX)/(w + W)$
\State $w \gets w + W$ 
\EndFor
\EndProcedure
